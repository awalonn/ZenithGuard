Block ads, trackers, and pop-ups with a multi-layer defense. Features a smart heuristic engine and an element hider.

Take back control of your browsing experience with ZenithGuard, the intelligent, multi-layer ad and behavior blocker from Nexus Forge.

ZenithGuard is more than just a simple ad blockerâ€”it's a complete defense system designed for a faster, cleaner, and safer internet. Built with a powerful and efficient engine, ZenithGuard protects you without slowing down your browser.


KEY FEATURES:

Massive Static Blocklist: At its core, ZenithGuard uses a powerful, pre-compiled list of over 30,000 known ad, tracker, and malware domains, providing instant, broad-spectrum protection.

Smart Heuristic Sentinel: Our intelligent engine proactively hunts for new and unknown threats by identifying suspicious patterns in URLs. It can block threats before they're even added to the list.

Interactive Element Sieve: Annoying "Sign up for our newsletter" popups? Leftover blank spaces where ads used to be? Activate the Element Sieve, click on any element on any page, and hide it forever. You teach ZenithGuard how to clean the web for you.

User-Directed Behavior Blocker: Stop untrusted sites from opening annoying pop-up tabs. Our intention-based system is smart enough to block automated pop-ups while still allowing you to open new tabs with a Ctrl+Click or Middle-Click.

Complete User Control: A simple, intuitive interface lets you easily turn protection on or off globally, whitelist trusted sites, and manage your personal list of hidden elements.


ZenithGuard is lightweight, privacy-focused, and gives you the tools you need to create your own perfect web experience. Download today and reach the zenith of clean browsing.
